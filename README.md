# Credit Risk & Loan Default Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer credit risk and loan default behavior using real-world financial data.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (for aggregation and analysis)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboards)

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and feature selection
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying key risk factors such as income, age, and credit score
- Preparing model-ready dataset

## Key Insights
- Lower income and lower credit scores are strongly associated with loan defaults
- Younger applicants show slightly higher default risk
- External credit scores are the most predictive features

## Dataset
- 300,000+ loan records
- Cleaned and reduced to essential features for clarity and performance

## Status
- Python analysis completed
- SQL & Power BI dashboards in progress
